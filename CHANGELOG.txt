v.0.0.8

- Revert back to AzureLib LightBlock/Entity now that it's multiloader compatible.
- Require at least AzureLib 2.0.3.

Known WIP things left to do: 
	- Graboids need extra hitboxes.
	- Graboids are missing extra attacks (grabbing).
	- Graboids are missing breaking blocks when attacking (biting/grabbing)
	- Graboids digging in and out need some more tuning turning to only render when digging up/derender when digging down.
	- 8 Gauge reload animation is a place holder and will be replaced.
	- Blasters flying off needs finished.
