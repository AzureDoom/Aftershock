v.0.0.6

- Updates required AzureLib version to v1.0.32.
- Fixes early init crash with Connector.
- Adds AzureLib to Connector builds required mods list, no longer bundled as you can use the Forge version safely with Fabric mods.

Known WIP things left to do: 
	- Graboids need extra hitboxes.
	- Graboids are missing extra attacks (grabbing).
	- Graboids are missing breaking blocks when attacking (biting/grabbing)
	- Graboids digging in and out need some more tuning turning to only render when digging up/derender when digging down.
	- 8 Gauge reload animation is a place holder and will be replaced.
	- Blasters flying off needs finished.
